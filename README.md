# SteamAchievementTracker
This is a project which will eventually provide statistics to guide people who want to get the most out of their game library on Steam by getting 100% completion in as many games as possible. In order to use this project, you will need to obtain an API key from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). The API key can then be automatically configured by using the -apikey argument along with the API key previously obtained from Steam. An example of this would be `dotnet run -apikey 92` if the API key was 92.
